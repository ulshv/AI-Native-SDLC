# Platform

The platform core (k3s, Argo CD, Postgres, Gitea, Plane) for this repository, built and
rebuilt by one command. After the bootstrap, every change to the platform is a git push.

## Run

Install the [host prerequisites](../README.md#host-prerequisites) first, then from the
repository root:

```bash
platform/bootstrap.sh   # build or rebuild the platform; safe to re-run
platform/smoke.sh       # check that it works
```
